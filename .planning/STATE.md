## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Build in layers — foundation → conversion → content → Remotion → polish. Remotion isolated so it never blocks shipping.
- [Roadmap]: Two-state CTA (env var) goes in Phase 1 foundation, not Phase 2, because it's an architectural decision that affects every CTA component.
- [Roadmap]: RESP-01 and RESP-03 in Phase 1 (not Phase 5) — responsive viewport and contrast must be right from day one per research pitfall guidance.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Real iOS simulator screenshots needed before Phase 3 content can be finalized (production asset dependency, not code dependency)
- Resend domain verification (DKIM/SPF/DMARC) should happen during Phase 1 setup to avoid spam issues in Phase 2
- Remotion composition designs (habit checkoff, heatmap fill) need to be designed before Phase 4
