<objective>
Build the Pricing/Value philosophy section and the "What's Next" teaser section, then wire them into the page after the three feature sections and before the bottom CTA.

Purpose: Pricing completes the conversion argument ("it's free, and paid is fair"), What's Next creates forward momentum and excitement for upcoming features. Together they round out the content story before the final CTA nudge.
Output: Two new section components with brand-aligned philosophical copy, integrated into the live page.

Create `src/components/features/pricing-section.tsx`:
- This is a brand statement section, NOT a pricing table or comparison cards.
- Use Section (fullHeight={false}, generous padding `py-24 md:py-32 lg:py-40`) and Container (size="narrow" — this is text-centric, keep it intimate).
- Wrap all content in ScrollReveal variant="stagger" so children stagger in.
- Structure: centered text layout (text-center).
  - Text variant="small" with uppercase tracking-wide label: something like "PRICING" or "THE MODEL"
  - Heading as h2: Bold anti-subscription philosophical headline. Tone reference: "No Subscriptions. No Trials. No Tricks." energy. Claude's discretion on exact copy — aim for punchy, honest, defiant. Examples: "Your Wallet Can Relax.", "Free. Really.", "We Don't Do Subscriptions."
  - Text variant="muted": 2-3 short sentences max communicating:
    1. Momentum is free to use — genuinely, not freemium-bait
    2. Optional Pro tier will be available as a yearly subscription OR a one-time purchase (user's choice)
    3. Light tease of 1-2 Pro features (advanced insights, custom themes) — brief, not a feature list
  - Keep the tone conversational and honest. This is talking TO someone, not marketing AT them. Think: "We built this because every habit tracker nickel-and-dimes you. That's over."
- Claude's discretion on whether to include a simple icon/symbol above the headline (e.g., a subtle ∞ symbol or similar), or keep it purely typographic. The section should feel equal in visual weight to the feature sections — a full cinematic "moment," not a footnote.
- Use existing design tokens: font-display for headline, font-body for description, text-text and text-text-muted colors.
- Wrap each text block in motion.div (from motion/react) children using fadeUp variants for stagger effect.

Create `src/components/features/whats-next-section.tsx`:
- Client component ("use client" — uses motion for staggered card animations).
- Use Section (fullHeight={false}, generous padding) and Container (default size).
- Structure:
  - Top: ScrollReveal wrapping centered intro text:
    - Text variant="small" uppercase tracking-wide: "COMING SOON" or "WHAT'S NEXT"
    - Heading as h2: Philosophical headline wrapping the concept of future/roadmap. Example: "The Road Ahead." or "What We're Building Next." — mysterious + transparent. Claude's discretion.
    - Text variant="muted": One sentence of honest framing — "We're not done. Here's what's coming." energy.
  - Below: A row/grid of 3 feature teaser cards:
    - Layout: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 md:gap-8 mt-12 md:mt-16`
    - Each card: a div with `bg-surface rounded-2xl p-6 md:p-8 border border-border` (uses existing tokens)
    - Each card has: small uppercase label/category, Heading as h4 (feature name), Text variant="muted" (one sentence description)
    - Three cards:
      1. **AI Reflections** — Label: "INTELLIGENCE". Headline: "AI Reflections" or similar. Description: Something about AI-powered insights on your habits — honest that it's upcoming, not ready yet.
      2. **Token Economy** — Label: "MOTIVATION". Headline: "Rest Tokens" or "Token Economy" or similar. Description: Something about earning rest days through consistency — a unique mechanic, teased briefly.
      3. **HealthKit** — Label: "INTEGRATION". Headline: "HealthKit Sync" or similar. Description: Something about connecting habit data with health metrics — brief, factual.
    - Each card should be wrapped in a motion.div with fadeUp variant and staggered delay (0.1s, 0.2s, 0.3s) for sequential reveal effect. Or use ScrollReveal variant="stagger" as the grid container with motion.div children — follow the pattern from animations.ts staggerContainer.
  - Claude's discretion on whether to include a small CTA tying back to the waitlist ("Join the waitlist to be first") or let the bottom CTA section handle conversion. The CONTEXT.md explicitly gives this choice. Leaning toward NO CTA here to keep it clean — the bottom CTA is right below.
- Export as named function component.

    - `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
    - Both components export correctly

    - WhatsNextSection renders 3 teaser cards with surface bg and border tokens
  </verify>
  <done>
    PricingSection renders a conversational pricing/value brand statement with philosophical headline and honest anti-subscription copy. WhatsNextSection renders 3 upcoming feature teaser cards (AI Reflections, Token Economy, HealthKit) with staggered scroll-triggered reveals. Both follow established component patterns and design tokens.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Wire pricing and What's Next sections into page.tsx</name>
  <files>
    src/app/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Update `src/app/page.tsx` to import and render the Pricing and What's Next sections.

Add imports:
```
import { PricingSection } from "@/components/features/pricing-section";
import { WhatsNextSection } from "@/components/features/whats-next-section";
```

Insert AFTER the three feature sections (CustomizationSection) and BEFORE the Bottom CTA section:
```jsx
{/* Pricing */}
<PricingSection />

{/* What's Next */}
<WhatsNextSection />
```

Final page order should be:
1. Hero (existing)
2. HabitTrackingSection (from 03-02)
3. HeatmapSection (from 03-02)
4. CustomizationSection (from 03-02)
5. PricingSection (this plan)
6. WhatsNextSection (this plan)
7. Bottom CTA (existing)
8. Footer (existing)

Note: If 03-02 hasn't executed yet (feature sections not in page.tsx), that's fine — both plans are wave 2 and may execute in parallel. Just ensure the pricing and what's next imports and JSX are positioned correctly relative to the bottom-cta comment marker. If feature sections are already present in page.tsx, insert after them. If not, insert after the hero section closing — the other plan will insert its sections in the right place too.

Do NOT modify hero, bottom-cta, or footer sections.

    - `npm run build` succeeds
    - `npm run dev` — visit localhost:3000 and scroll to see Pricing section after features (or after hero if features not yet wired)
    - Pricing section shows philosophical headline + conversational copy, centered layout
    - What's Next section shows 3 teaser cards with stagger animation
    - Both sections animate in on scroll
    - Responsive: cards stack vertically on mobile (1 col), row on desktop (3 cols)
    - Page flow feels natural: features → pricing → what's next → bottom CTA
  </verify>
  <done>
    Pricing and What's Next sections are live on the page. The full content story is complete: features demonstrate value, pricing removes objections, What's Next creates excitement, bottom CTA captures the conversion. Build succeeds.
