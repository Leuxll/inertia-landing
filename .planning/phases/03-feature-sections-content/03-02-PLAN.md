<objective>
Build the three feature content sections — Habit Tracking, Heatmaps/Insights, and Customization — using the FeatureSection and PhoneFrame components from Plan 01, then wire them into the page between the hero and bottom CTA.

Purpose: These sections are the core content that communicates what Momentum does. The philosophical headlines do the heavy lifting; screenshots provide visual proof.
Output: Three feature section components with brand-aligned copy, integrated into the live page.

  <name>Task 1: Three feature section components with philosophical copy</name>

  </files>
  <action>
Create `src/components/features/` directory with three section components. Each is a thin wrapper around FeatureSection, providing the content props. These can be server components if FeatureSection handles all the client-side animation (check the 03-01 SUMMARY — if FeatureSection is "use client", these wrappers can be server components that just pass props).

**Habit Tracking Section** (`habit-tracking-section.tsx`):
- `id="features"` (first feature section, nav anchor point)
- `imagePosition="left"` (phone on left, text on right)
- `screenshotSrc="/screenshots/placeholder-habits.svg"`
- `screenshotAlt="Momentum habit tracking interface showing daily habits with completion status"`
- Headline: "It Hurts. It Helps." — philosophical, not descriptive. The headline IS the brand voice.
  - Consider splitting into headline="It Hurts." headlineAccent="It Helps." if the FeatureSection API supports that split for italic styling
- Description: One sentence that bridges the philosophical to the practical. Something like: "Track what matters. Skip the gamification. Just you and your streaks, beautifully laid bare." — keep it under 20 words, muted tone, honest.
- Claude has discretion on exact copy — the tone guide is: existential + honest + minimal. Think "Apple meets Camus."

**Heatmaps/Insights Section** (`heatmap-section.tsx`):
- `imagePosition="right"` (phone on right, text on left — alternating rhythm)
- `screenshotSrc="/screenshots/placeholder-heatmap.svg"`
- `screenshotAlt="Momentum heatmap visualization showing habit consistency patterns over time"`
- Headline: "Decode the Habits That Define You." — or similar philosophical take on data/insight
  - Accent portion could be "That Define You." for italic emphasis
- Description: One sentence about seeing patterns emerge. Something like: "Heatmaps and insights that reveal what your consistency actually looks like — no sugar-coating."
- Same tone rules apply.

**Customization Section** (`customization-section.tsx`):
- `imagePosition="left"` (phone on left — back to left, creating left-right-left zigzag)
- `screenshotSrc="/screenshots/placeholder-customize.svg"`
- `screenshotAlt="Momentum customization options showing theme and appearance settings"`
- Headline: "Make It Yours." with accent "Yours." — or something that speaks to ownership/personalization
- Description: One sentence about customization being about identity, not just aesthetics. Something like: "Dark themes, custom accents, your layout — because a tool should feel like it belongs to you."
- Same tone rules.

All three components export a named function component. Keep them simple — the FeatureSection component handles all layout and animation complexity.

    - `npx tsc --noEmit` passes
    - All three components export correctly
    - Each component uses FeatureSection with the correct props

  <done>
    Three feature section components exist with philosophical brand-aligned copy, alternating image positions (left, right, left), and placeholder screenshots.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Wire feature sections into page.tsx</name>
  <files>
    src/app/page.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
Update `src/app/page.tsx` to import and render the three feature sections between the Hero section and the Bottom CTA section.

Add imports at the top:
```
import { HabitTrackingSection } from "@/components/features/habit-tracking-section";
import { HeatmapSection } from "@/components/features/heatmap-section";
import { CustomizationSection } from "@/components/features/customization-section";
```

Insert between `</Section>` (hero closing) and `{/* Bottom CTA */}`:
```jsx
{/* Features */}
<HabitTrackingSection />
<HeatmapSection />
<CustomizationSection />
```

Optionally add a subtle Divider between the hero and first feature section if the visual transition needs separation — use Claude's judgment based on how the spacing feels. The FeatureSection's own vertical padding should provide enough breathing room.

Do NOT modify the hero or bottom-cta sections — those are complete from Phase 2.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npm run build` succeeds
    - `npm run dev` — visit localhost:3000 and scroll past hero to see three feature sections
    - Each section is visually distinct with its own headline, description, and device-framed placeholder image
    - Sections animate in as you scroll (not visible on initial load)
    - Image positions alternate: left, right, left
    - Responsive: on mobile, sections stack vertically with text above image
  </verify>
  <done>
    Three feature sections visible on the live page between hero and bottom CTA. Each animates into view on scroll. Image positions alternate creating a zigzag visual rhythm. Page builds and runs without errors.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npm run build` passes with zero errors
- Page loads at localhost:3000 and shows: Hero → Habit Tracking → Heatmaps → Customization → Bottom CTA → Footer
- Each feature section has: philosophical headline (with accent/italic styling), one-sentence description, device-framed screenshot
- Scroll-triggered animations work: sections are NOT visible on page load, they reveal as you scroll to them
- On mobile (375px): sections stack vertically, text above image, readable and properly spaced
- On desktop (1440px): two-column layout with alternating image positions
- Copy tone is consistent: philosophical, honest, minimal — matches "It Hurts. It Helps." energy
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- 3 feature sections render between hero and bottom CTA with philosophical headlines and placeholder screenshots
- Alternating image positions create visual rhythm (left-right-left)
- Scroll-triggered animations reveal each section as user scrolls
- Responsive layout: two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile
- Build succeeds, no type errors
</success_criteria>
